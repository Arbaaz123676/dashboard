# Open Source Software Metrics Dashboard

A dashboard to get an overview of your organization's open source repository health.

The dashboard fetches data from the GitHub API and displays it in a Quarto-powered site. It provides the following information about your repositories:

- Repository metadata (license, topics, stars, forks, watchers)
- Issue and PR counts (open, closed, merged)
- Metrics around response times for issues
- Download statistics from PyPI and Conda

## Configuration

Edit `oss_dashboard/config.yml` to configure the dashboard:

```yaml
---
# Organizations to pull metrics from (can be a single string or array)
organization: ['org-name-1', 'org-name-2']

# Start date to pull metrics from (ISO 8601 format)
since: '2024-01-01'

# GitHub Pages base path (for relative asset paths)
basePath: '/dashboard'
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following variables:

```sh
GRAPHQL_TOKEN=your_github_token
PEPY_API_KEY=your_pepy_api_key
```

The `GRAPHQL_TOKEN` requires the following GitHub scopes:
- `read:org`
- `read:repo`
- `read:project`

> [!NOTE]
> To fetch collaborator counts, the token must belong to an organization admin.

Get a PEPY API key from [pepy.tech](https://www.pepy.tech/pepy-api) for PyPI download statistics.

## Installation

```sh
pip install ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

### Fetch Data

```sh
python -m oss_dashboard.main
```

This fetches metrics for all configured organizations and writes JSON files to `oss_dashboard/data/`.

### Render Dashboard

Requires [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to be installed.

```sh
quarto render
```

This creates a static HTML site in the `build` directory.
